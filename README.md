# SAT-Scores-vs-Poverty

## Background
This is a python program that uses pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. It plots average NYC Public School SAT scores against the percentage of the school's students living in poverty. The school's average SAT scores are from 2014-2015 school year. The % of students living in poverty is an average of the school's 2017-2022 data. Because the years do not align perfectly, this is not a perfect comparison. However, the percentage of students living in poverty at each school does not change that much year-to-year, so it is a reasonable comparison. I used the data that was available to me online.

## How-to
Install Jupyter notebook and import this notebook. Download csv file and move to the same directory as this notebook.
