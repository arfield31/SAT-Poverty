# SAT-Scores-vs-Poverty

## Background
This is a python program that uses pandas, matplotlib and seaborn. It plots average NYC Public School SAT scores against the percentage of the school's students living in poverty. I used data from different years to extract the school's average SAT scores and percentage of students living in poverty, because it was the only data I had available to me. The school's average SAT scores are from the 2014-2015 school year. The percentage of students living in poverty is an average of the school's 2017-2022 data. Because the years do not align perfectly, this is not a perfect comparison. However, it's reasonable to expect each school's percentage of students living in poverty would not change drastically over the course of a few years, so the graph still provides helpful insight into the correlation between the two variables.

The graph also does not show any schools above 95% poverty. For the sake of the schools' privacy, the data I used did not cite specific statistics for schools above this threshold. All the schools that were listed as "above 95% poverty" are plotted on the graph at exactly 95%.
